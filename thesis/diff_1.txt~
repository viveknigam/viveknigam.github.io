  -In many situations, it is possible to compute in {\em constant time} if          
   a synthetic connective can be used to help prove a given sequent.  In            
   particular, it is easy to show that it takes constant time to build a

  +The strong adequacy obtained for the encoding of \Name\ only ensures
   that any logic interpreter that searches for focused proofs by
   decomposing synthetic connectives will construct objects that
   correspond to computation runs of \Name\ programs. However, in order to
   analyze the complexity of algorithms, we must enter into
   implementation details. We now briefly propose an implementation that can,
