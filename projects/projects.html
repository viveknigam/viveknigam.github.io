      <h2>Projects Currently Active</h2>

<ul>
<li>Title: ASSET I and II &#8211; Avionics Systems Software Embedded Technology</li>
</ul>


<p>Developing avionic components remains a challenge as there are many players involved using
different technologies for modeling and developing products. The main objective of this project
is to study the use of Model Based Engineering to help the development process.</p>

<ul>
<li>Title: Systems with Multimodal Restrictions: Foundations and Applications</li>
</ul>


<p>Computational systems often are restricted by differents types/modes aspects. For example, web-servers are restricted by the amount of memory allocated, or cyber-physical systems by the energy available. This project aims to build the foundations for specifying and analysing such systems. We consider the use of quantitative constraints, investigating how to automate verification, and apply our techniques to the most varied systems.</p>

<ul>
<li>GT-ACTIONS: A Computational Framework for the Mitigation of Denial of Service Attacks</li>
</ul>


<p>Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks remain
among the most dangerous and noticeable attacks on the Internet.
Differently from previous attacks, many recent DDoS attacks
have not been carried out over the network layer, but over
the application layer. The main difference is that in the latter,
an attacker can target a particular application of the server,
while leaving the remaining applications still available, thus
generating less traffic and being harder to detect. This project&#8217;s main objective
is to develop a framework for building defenses against such attacks.</p>

<h2>Old Projects</h2>

<ul>
<li>Title: Regulated Colaborative Systems: Foundations and Applications</li>
</ul>


<p>In a collaborative system, agents work together in order to achieve a common goal, but at the same time, try to avoid that bad things happen, that is, bad states are reached. An example of such a collaboration is a clinical investigation (CI), which is a set of procedures in medical research and drug development, whose goal is to test a new drug or other intervention on human subjects. In a CI, subjects, nurses, doctors, hospital administrators, regulatory agencies, clinical research organizations (CRO), and pharmaceutical companies (Sponsors) collaborate in order to test the effectiveness of the experimental drug, so that it can be approved by public agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This project&#8217;s mais objective is to develop a formal executable semantics for Regulated Collaborative Systems which is amenable to formal verification tools.</p>

<ul>
<li>Title: Collaborative Systems with Explicit Time</li>
</ul>


<p>Time is important for setting the rules and goals of a successful collaboration. This project&#8217;s main goal is to develop a framework for the specification of complex collaborative systems with explicit time; investigate the foundational differences of such models; and apply such framework.</p>

<ul>
<li>A Proof Theory for Concurrency</li>
</ul>


<p>As the world gets more interconnected and softwares more distributed, it becomes more important that computer scientists and engineers are able to correctly model and formally specify concurrent processes. As logic and proof theory have a long tradition on dealing with formal languages and provide powerful tools to reason about them, they have been successfully used to model computation. In particular, the recent years have witnessed an increase on our understanding of the application of proof theory, in the context of the computation-as-deduction paradigm, as a framework to specify and reason about computation systems.
The main objective of this project is to exploit recent proof theoretic developments to provide a general framework and reasoning techniques for concurrency. The scien- tific impact of the project will be twofold: on one hand, deep proof theoretic insights will be required in order to propose such framework and techniques. On the other hand, not only existing concepts in concurrency shall be given proof theoretic expla- nations, but also new concepts shall emerge, leading towards a general proof theory for concurrency.</p>
