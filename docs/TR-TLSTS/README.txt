In this directory you can find the Maude source code implementing
the different optimization techniques, small-step vs big-step 
and non-commutative branching vs commutative branching, for the 
scenario reported in the technical report on timed local state 
transition systems. There is also a Open Office spreadsheet 
summarizing all the results obtained.

At the end of the files we list some experiments using Maude with 
different parameters for initial configurations. During this experiments
Maude searches for a compliant plan.
